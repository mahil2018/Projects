Here too is evidence of 10,000 years of human history, from pirates and shipwrecks to pineapple farmers and presidents. Outdoors enthusiasts can boat, snorkel, camp, watch wildlife…or simply relax in a rocking chair gazing out over the bay.","containsPlace":[{"@context":"http://schema.org/","telephone":"305.230.1144","faxNumber":"305.230.1190","openingHoursSpecification":[{"dayOfWeek":"http://schema.org/Sunday","closes":"17:00:00","description":"The Dante Fascell Visitor Center is open daily from 9 AM to 5 PM.
